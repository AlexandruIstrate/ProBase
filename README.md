[![Build status](https://dev.azure.com/Alexandru-Istrate/ProBase/_apis/build/status/azure/ProBase-Default)](https://dev.azure.com/Alexandru-Istrate/ProBase/_build/latest?definitionId=2)

ProBase is the new way of accessing databases in C#. Unlike any other strategies like using query strings directly in the code or using an ORM, ProBase alows you to communicate with a database by using the most flexible and safe system - stored procedures. What ProBase adds on top of the classic ADO.NET data primitives is the ability to generate procedure calls based on annotated methods, thus allowing you to call a procedure in the same way you would call a method.
